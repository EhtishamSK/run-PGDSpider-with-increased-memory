To increase the memory available to PGDSpider and ensure smooth conversion of large files, start PGDSpider with higher memory allocation by adjusting the -Xmx and -Xms parameters. After launching PGDSpider, select the VCF file as the input format and choose STRUCTURE as the output format. Configure any relevant parameters, such as the number of populations or loci, and click "Convert" to generate the STRUCTURE file. Ensure that you allocate sufficient memory for your dataset without overloading your systemâ€™s resources.
